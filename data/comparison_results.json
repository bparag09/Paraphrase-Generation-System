Diagnostic tests included a chest X-ray, which showed haziness in the lower lung fields, and a 12-lead ECG with non-specific ST-T changes. Laboratory studies were ordered to evaluate inflammatory markers, cardiac enzymes, and arterial blood gases. The differential diagnosis considered included infectious pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, early-stage heart failure, and potential cardiac ischemia due to the chest discomfort.",
