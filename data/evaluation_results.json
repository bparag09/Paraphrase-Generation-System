During the initial clinical evaluation, the patient exhibited an elevated resting heart rate, mild tachypnea, and reduced oxygen saturation levels during minimal activity. The patient denied prior episodes of similar severity but reported a gradual decline in exercise tolerance over the past month. The diagnostic workup began with baseline investigations, including chest radiography and a standard 12-lead ECG. The chest X-ray revealed subtle haziness in the lower lung fields, while the ECG demonstrated non-specific ST-T changes that did not conclusively indicate ischemia but warranted further monitoring. Laboratory studies were ordered to assess inflammatory markers, cardiac enzymes, and arterial blood gases. The differential diagnosis at this stage included infectious pneumonia, an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, early-stage heart failure, and possible cardiac ischemia, given the nature of the chest discomfort.",
